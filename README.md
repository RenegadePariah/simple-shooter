3. Game instructions

The player (the white ball) exists on one of three circular terrains (red, green and blue). The player automatically shoots bullets at a constant rate. Targets spawn around the player, shooting their own bullets. These bullets rebound on the edges of the world. When one such bullet hits the player, the world shrinks, until there is no longer any room for the player to move. At that moment the player transitions to the next terrain (which may still have old, undestroyed targets).

The player shoots two kinds of bullets: the default, shrinking bullets are the only type which may damage and destroy targets. The smaller they become, the most damage they induce. The second kind grow instead of shrinking: those may only neutralize enemy bullets, but there is no limit to the number of neutralized bullets. In contrast, shrinking bullets are expanded at first collision.

Targets grow at a certain speed, unique to that particular target. The faster it grows, the more difficult it is to destroy. Destroyed targets no longer grow.

The game is lost when the player can no longer move, and did not succeed to destroy at least one target since the previous terrain collapse.

After 10 minutes, the spawning targets are no longer capable of being destroyed by the player, as they grow at a faster rate than the maximum, diametrical, damage output of the player (the target can still be shrunk, at a distance, but it is a pointless effort). The game changes visual appearance at that time. A skilled player may possibly survive many more transitions afterwards, as he could destroy older targets with weaker growth.

5. Bugs/updates

There will be no fix nor maintenance of any kind. If the game does not work, you should first attempt to update your graphic drivers. If that fails, consider deletion of the game on your computer.

If you experience difficulty changing the dimensions of the window, it could help to only resize while the splash image is still visible.

This game has been created on a dying computer by an overextended homeless man.
